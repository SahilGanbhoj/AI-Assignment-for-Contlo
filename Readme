Structured Completion Update for Contlo

I am pleased to report that I have completed the majority of the tasks outlined in Assignment 2_BT20ECE022.pdf to the best of my ability. Below is a summary of my progress for each task:

Task 1: Model Checkpoints Integration (Task1.py)

Successfully located and integrated pre-trained model checkpoints into the code using download_model.py.
This required careful analysis of checkpoint compatibility and integration methods.
Task 2: Architectural Changes (Task2.py)

Implemented two challenging modifications:
Sliding Window Attention: This involved understanding the algorithm and adapting it to the existing code structure. I overcame difficulties with memory optimization and window size selection.
Rotary Positional Embedding: I successfully coded this technique based on research papers and achieved accurate embedding integration.
Task 3: Distributed Training (Task3.py)

While I am confident in the direction of my implementation, this task remains partly incomplete.
I have provided a partial code base in Task3.py outlining my approach for distributing training across multiple GPUs.
Additional work is needed to finalize communication protocols and optimize performance.
Deliverables:

Code for all tasks is available in separate Python files: Task1.py, Task2.py, and Task3.py.
For reference, I have also attached the image you provided for Task 3.
Next Steps:

I am eager to receive your feedback on my work and discuss potential improvements.
I am happy to clarify any uncertainties or provide additional support for finalizing Task 3.
